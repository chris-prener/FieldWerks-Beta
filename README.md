# `FieldWerks-Beta`

FieldWerks is a lightweight, flexible software solution designed to collect data during field observations. FieldWerks is particularly suited for projects that integrate geocoding and qualitative field work into their research design.

FieldWerks requires an installation of [FileMaker Go](http://www.filemaker.com/products/filemaker-go/) on your mobile devices.

FieldWerks has not been regularly maintained since I completed the collection of my dissertaion field work, and the current documentation for the Beta refers to older features of iOS.
